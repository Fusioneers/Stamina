The aim of our project is to develop an app that animates its users to move by means of a game.

The app is supposed to give the user an exercise and recognize via a webcam whether he performs it correctly.

For this purpose, the body parts relevant for a level are marked with colored markers, whose positions are recorded and evaluated by the app.

The program should be able to be used in combination with aids (e.g. dumbbells, etc.), which may also be marked in color.

Initially, we would like to develop the app for PCs and laptops, since we have more computing power available here. The most important code will be written in Python using, among others, the libraries OpenCV and NumPy.

I would like to put a special focus on variability (through universal level interpreter, which allows easy addition of new "levels", and through an integrated calibration tool to adjust the colors to lighting conditions).
